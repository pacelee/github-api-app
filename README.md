This is a simple search query that uses Github API  
to pull some information about any user you type in.

You must add a .env file with the following:  
exports.apiKey = "APIKEYHERE";

Once you have cloned the repository run npm install  
and bower install to acquire the proper components.

Afterwards run gulp build --production followed by gulp serve
